Hi, 

I am Mustafa. Since you are visiting my page I assume you are interested in what I do. So here is a quick bio.  


I have worked in several research areas over the years. I have started out as a Mathematical Physicist,
it was hard for me to resist the power and beauty of analytical solutions to complex problems.
That was also the theme of my publications in mathematical physics, namely, Super-symmetric Quantum Mechanics.
It is a group theoretic construction that is at the heart of exactly-solvable quantum mechanical 
systems. It also provides a prescription for constructing state raising and lowering operators.
It turns out there are a few families of exactly solvable potentials with limited practical applications.
I was lucky to discover one potential that turned out to have an application in atomic physics. My atomic physics 
colleagues at Berlin Max-Planck Institute and Purdue [M. Lemeshko, S. Kais and B. Friedrich] recognized that and we ended up publishing two papers about it.  

As soon as I started grad school I got tempted by the mother of all topics in physics,
particle physics. I joined the [STAR Experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STAR_detector) mid 2010, one of the two operating heavy-ion experiments 
at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider ([RHIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativistic_Heavy_Ion_Collider)), in Long Island, NY. 
The central goal of heavy-ion physics is to characterize 
the states of nuclear matter, we do this by colliding nuclei at large colliders (at RHIC and the LHC) at 
very (ultra-relativistic) high energies. When the high energy of moving nuclei is dumped in a small point in head-on 
collisions a new state of nuclear matter forms that is composed of the constituents of the protons and neutrons. 
We think that this medium is a Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP), the same as the state of the universe a few microseconds 
after the Big Bang. In the lab, this ~10^-15 m droplet disintegrates into particles after ~10^-22 s. 
Using specialized detectors we collect the particles debris of this collision and we study their kinematics and 
correlations to understand the dynamics of the formed novel state of matter. Due to the short lifetime of the 
collision and the rapid dynamics the only way to study it is to collect billions of such collisions data and analyze it offline.   

I spent 6 years carrying research as a member of the STAR experiment (+550 scientists collaboration), 
3 years as a graduate student and 3 years as a postdoctoral fellow. During these years I have worked on 
several key heavy flavor physics measurements, the most important of which have been awaited by the community for
more than a decade and will be published very soon.   

While my primary goal was the physics, my day to day job was C++, software design, clusters infrastructure, 
data processing pipelines, detectors calibration & alignment and most importantly, simulations & systematics 
analysis.   

Recently I started a Data Postdoctoral Fellowship at [NERSC](www.nersc.gov). With the skills that I have 
learned during my years at STAR, I am helping more US experiments with their computing infrastructure. My main focus now
is on helping the LHC and Cosmology (DESI, DESC, LZ) experiments to move their workflows to [Cori](http://www.nersc.gov/users/computational-systems/cori/)
 HPC, on both Haswell and KNL nodes.  

For research, I started delving into Deep Learning. I think Generative Models can emulate many physics 
simulators. Why is that important? I have two reasons for now:  
1.  Many physics simulations are computationally expensive to produce, with DL you can use a smaller 
set of simulations to train a model that can sample/explore (with a grain of salt for now) other modalities.  
2.  DL can discover lower level (as opposed to physicists higher level) features that can help us 
create more efficient fast simulators. Basically, I think Generative Models can 
help us create Simulators Emulators. I will have more to say about this in my blog soon.  
<!--Let me elaborate on this point a bit: many of the important measurements in particle physics (by extension 
in heavy-ion physics) boils down to calculating a normalized cross-section that can be compared to theoretical 
calculations. A normalized cross-section is roughly the probability of a certain phenomenon (for example 
of observing a D meson with momentum 1 GeV at a particular angle) in a collision at a particular energy.
The interesting phenomena is typically a rare one, a D meson pair is expected to form in a p-p collision at 
a nominal RHIC collision energy once per 500 collisions. Add to that the finite acceptance (equivalent to a factor 
of 0.43 D measurements at STAR) of our detectors (we don't cover a full 4-$\pi$ around the collision point) 
and the detector inefficiency 
(we detect and identify a fraction of the generated particles). On top of that 
If you do the math for my STAR D meson pair
example at RHIC -->
